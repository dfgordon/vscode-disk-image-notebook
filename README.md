# vscode-disk-image-notebook

Look inside disk images right from your VS Code project.  Clicking on a supported disk image will show the disk directory in the file system's native style.  Various commands are available for extracting files, examining sectors, etc.

This will not modify the disk image.  If the notebook is saved, the disk image is written back, but with no changes.  The notebook itself, i.e. its cells, cannot be saved, although cell contents can be moved to other documents using the clipboard.
